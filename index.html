            <h2>About the tool</h2>
            <p>
            This tool scans the files within lookup.txt and compares the fingerprint of the certificate you receive locally to the fingerprint that is obtained remotely. If there
             are any differences it could be a result of a MITM attack where your traffic is being actively decrypted. This tool is super de-duper alpha and google.com is sometimes
              falsely flagged. There are no false negatives but false positives are possible.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use</h2>
            Currently the only way to update the sites to get a fingerprint for is by editing the &quot;lookup.txt&quot; file. Add/remove entries from there and then restart the app.
